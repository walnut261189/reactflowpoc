Large enterprises operating in highly regulated environments frequently encounter bottlenecks when managing infrastructure and data workflows. These challenges stem from complex configurations, strict compliance mandates, and role-based access control (RBAC), often resulting in long wait times and high dependency on centralized teams. This white paper proposes a novel approach: integrating a Generative AI-powered assistant within Microsoft Teams to act as a natural language control plane. By converting user prompts into secure, policy-compliant deployments, the assistant democratizes access to infrastructure and data platforms without compromising governance.

The proposed system interprets natural language inputs and, using contextual understanding of enterprise policy, automatically generates Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) templates and orchestrates data workflows. It validates user permissions, suggests pre-approved configurations, and proactively flags any RBAC or compliance issues, escalating them to appropriate approvers. This approach significantly accelerates the path from intent to execution, empowers engineers and analysts to be self-sufficient, and enforces enterprise standards from the outset. The white paper outlines the architecture, vertical use cases across Azure and Microsoft Fabric, and a future vision for self-healing and autonomous operations driven by conversational interfaces.
