Enterprises operating in tightly governed environments often struggle with infrastructure and data workflow self-service due to complex configurations, role-based access control (RBAC), and compliance overhead. This white paper proposes a solution leveraging Generative AI inside Microsoft Teams to translate natural language prompts into compliant infrastructure and data platform deployments. The assistant guides users through configuration, validates permissions, generates compliant Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) templates or data workflows, and proactively identifies and escalates RBAC issues.
