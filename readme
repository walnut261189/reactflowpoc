Large enterprises operating in tightly governed environments often struggle with infrastructure and data workflow self-service due to complex configurations, role-based access control (RBAC), and compliance overhead. These frictions lead to increased dependency on centralized teams, slower delivery cycles, and ultimately higher operational costs.

This white paper proposes a solution that embeds a Generative AI-powered assistant within Microsoft Teams to translate natural language prompts into compliant infrastructure and data platform deployments. By leveraging organizational policies, the assistant guides users through service configuration, validates permissions, generates Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) templates or data workflows, and identifies RBAC or compliance issues that require escalation.

This solution presents a unified horizontal interface that powers two strategic verticals: Azure Infrastructure Management and Microsoft Fabric Workflow Automation. In both domains, a single service account—backed by policy-based controls and AI mediation—can orchestrate multiple resource types on behalf of the user. This streamlines administrative overhead and lowers costs by reducing redundant service accounts and decentralizing request management.

From a cost-benefit perspective, enabling this intelligent layer reduces ticket volume to platform teams, accelerates go-to-market velocity for digital initiatives, and ensures secure, consistent deployments. It not only empowers developers and analysts to operate independently, but also aligns with enterprise IT governance objectives through AI-driven compliance enforcement.

The paper outlines architectural design, technical components, user scenarios, and cost advantages, offering a compelling path toward AI-native operational efficiency in cloud and data platform usage.
